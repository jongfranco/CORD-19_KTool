       "| w5is1tbo | Vaginal vault dehiscence after robotic hysterectomy for gynecologic cancers: search for risk factors and literature review. | 2013-01-01 00:00:00 | <strong>INTRODUCTION Vaginal vault dehiscence following robotic-assisted hysterectomy for gynecologic cancer may be attributed to surgical techniques and postoperative therapeutic interventions.</strong> We searched for risk factors in patients with gynecologic cancers and complemented this with a literature review. METHODS Evaluation of prospectively gathered information on all consecutive robotic surgeries for gynecologic cancers was performed in a tertiary academic cancer center between December 2007 and March 2012. The literature was reviewed for articles relevant to \"gynecologic oncology\" and \"robotics\" with \"vaginal cuff dehiscence\" in the English and French languages. Respective authors were contacted to complete relevant information. RESULTS Seven dehiscences were identified of 441 cases with established gynecologic cancers. The closures in these 7 were performed using interrupted 1-Vicryl (Ethicon Inc) (3/167; 1.8%), combination of interrupted 1-Vicryl and 1-Biosyn (Covidien Inc) (3/156, 1.9%), and V-Loc (Covidien Inc) (1/118, 0.8%) sutures. Associated risk factors included adjuvant chemotherapy and/or brachytherapy, early resumption of sexual activity, and low body mass index (mean, 23 ± 3.23 kg/m²). Dehiscences occurred regardless of suturing by staff or trainees. Review of operative videos did not reveal a detectable etiologic factor, such as excessive cautery damage to the vaginal cuff or shallow tissue sutured. All 7 colporrhexis repairs were performed through a vaginal approach without the need of laparoscopy or laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and early resumption of sexual activities are risk factors for vaginal vault dehiscence. Surgical technique, particularly the use of delayed absorbable sutures, deserves further evaluation. | 0.625486 |"

The repair strength, repair stiffness and gap resistance can be increased by increasing the number of core strands and anchor points, by increased anchor point efficiency and the use of peripheral sutures, and by using thicker sutures. In the future, laboratory tests could be standardized to a specific animal model and to a defined cyclic motion programme. Clinical studies support the use of multi-strand core and peripheral sutures, but two-strand core sutures are not adequate to ensure consistently good clinical results. Training surgeons in complex tendon repair techniques is essential. | 0.233197  | covid-19 pandemic disease coronavirus health cases care patients infection spread      |\n",
